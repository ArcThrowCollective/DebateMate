# Debate App Something

**(Political) debating platform based on real-time video/audio comms.**

## What is ... all about?

The landing page presents a list of channels as tiles. Guests can join public channels, or register to become Members. Members can create channels, and within a channel can create and manage debate rooms, as well as create announcements.
<br><br>
In debate rooms, members can debate using real-time peer-to-peer audio/video streaming (using WebRTC) and/or text chat. Members must have a "speaking permission" to speak, and can request permission using a button. Optionally, a member with the role Moderator handles those requests, controls a speech timer, etc.
